- 👋 Hi, I’m Katrin (❤️ MCU). 

I’m a Data Science student (09/2021-12/2021) at neuefische.
Before I started the Data Science bootcamp I studied Geography and Chemistry at HU in Berlin and worked for over 10 years in HR and Executive Search.
I am a traveller 🌎🌍🌏 and am crazy about snorkeling with 🐢🐠🐬 - it is the best to reduce the stress level in 1 second 😉
